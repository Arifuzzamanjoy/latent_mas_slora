      "title": "Facial Nerve (CN VII) Complete Anatomy",
      "content": "The facial nerve (cranial nerve VII) is a mixed nerve containing motor, sensory, and parasympathetic fibers. It exits the brainstem at the cerebellopontine angle, enters the internal acoustic meatus, and travels through the facial canal in the temporal bone.\n\nKey branches and their functions:\n1. Greater petrosal nerve - parasympathetic to lacrimal gland (lacrimation)\n2. Nerve to stapedius - dampens loud sounds (hyperacusis if damaged)\n3. Chorda tympani - taste to anterior 2/3 tongue, parasympathetic to submandibular/sublingual glands\n4. Terminal motor branches - muscles of facial expression\n\nThe nerve exits the skull through the stylomastoid foramen. Lesions at different levels produce distinct clinical findings:\n- At stylomastoid foramen: Loss of motor function only (facial paralysis)\n- Above chorda tympani: + loss of taste and salivation\n- At geniculate ganglion: + loss of lacrimation (dry eye)\n- At internal acoustic meatus: + hearing loss\n\nBell's palsy is idiopathic facial nerve paralysis, most common cause of unilateral facial weakness."
